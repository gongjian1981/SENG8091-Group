# Local Business Support

As group 9, we need to develop an app to promote and support local businesses.

## initial hypotheses

We came up with the following ideas after looking at the current situation and thinking about how people behave:

1. **Local businesses in Waterloo are hard to find online**, unlike big chain stores.
2. **People want to support local businesses**, but they don’t know where they are or what they sell.
3. **A fun and rewarding way to discover local shops** can encourage users to explore more.
4. **Local business owners will use a simple, affordable tool** if it’s easy to set up and helps them directly.

## Research Summary

To validate our problem and solution space, we reviewed various sources including government reports, local community feedback, industry studies, and competitive analysis.

### 1. **Local Economic Context**

* According to the *[Waterloo Region 2024 Workplace Count](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/doing-business/resources/Workplace-Count/Appendix-A_-2024-Workplace-Count-Bulletin.pdf)*, over 60% of businesses in the region are classified as small businesses.
* *[Analysis on small businesses in Canada, second quarter of 2024](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-621-m/11-621-m2024007-eng.htm)* shows that small businesses remain less optimistic than larger businesses.

### 2. **Digital Discovery Gap**

* According to the Ontario Chamber of Commerce's 2021 report "*[Broken Links: Driving Technology Adoption within Ontario's Small Businesses](https://occ.ca/wp-content/uploads/Broken-Links-Driving-Technology-Adoption-within-Ontarios-Small-Businesses.pdf)*", only 54% of small businesses felt they were benefiting from new technologies, compared to 81% of large businesses. This highlights a significant digital adoption gap that affects visibility and customer engagement for small businesses.
* Many Waterloo-based businesses rely solely on physical foot traffic or word-of-mouth.

### 3. **User Behavior Trends**

* *[Studies](https://www.businessthink.unsw.edu.au/articles/mobile-app-gamification-strategies)* show that people today are very motivated by rewards and interactive apps.
* According to a *[poll ](https://www.cfib-fcei.ca/en/media/news-releases/majority-canadians-are-choosing-shop-small-businesses-support-their-communities)* conducted by CFIB, 86% of customers say supporting Canadian small businesses is important to them.

### 4. **Competitive Landscape**

* Tools like Yelp and Google Maps exist, but they focus on reviews and navigation, not on local loyalty or rewards.
* Apps like Ritual focus more on chains and don’t help small businesses enough.
* There's no localized app tailored specifically for Waterloo.
