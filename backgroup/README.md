# Local Business Support

As group 9, we need to develop an app to promote and support local businesses.

## initial hypotheses

We came up with the following ideas after looking at the current situation and thinking about how people behave:

1. **Local businesses in Waterloo are hard to find online**, unlike big chain stores.
2. **People want to support local businesses**, but they don’t know where they are or what they sell.
3. **A fun and rewarding way to discover local shops** can encourage users to explore more.
4. **Local business owners will use a simple, affordable tool** if it’s easy to set up and helps them directly.
