### 1. Background Research

In this [section](/background/), we were given the problem: **“Develop an app to promote and support local businesses.”**

We observed that local businesses are struggling because they face strong competition from large chains and online platforms, and many lack the digital tools needed to attract and retain customers.

Based on this assumption, we conducted research on small business challenges, user behaviour, and digital engagement trends.

Our findings confirmed that there is a clear gap in visibility and customer engagement for local businesses, and that users are willing to support them if provided with a simple, rewarding, and centralized way to discover and interact with them.

As a solution, we propose developing a mobile app that enables users to discover and support local businesses through interactive maps, check-ins, reviews, and a rewards system—thereby enhancing both customer engagement and business visibility.

### 2. Requirements Gathering

Following our initial research and proposed solution, Deliverable 2 focuses on translating these insights into actionable system requirements and feature specifications.

The resulting [requirements](/requirements) serve as a blueprint for the development team, ensuring that the application aligns with business objectives, user needs, and technical feasibility.
